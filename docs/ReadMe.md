### Cds T4 Proxy Generator

This project provides tools for generating proxy classes for CDS entities and Sdk Messages using customizable T4 text templates. Project
artifacts include a CdsProxyGenerator library assembly that encapsulates the core functionality of the tool set, a command line 
executable that can be incorporated into DevOps processes, and a batch file that simplifies execution from within a development environment.

The code and concepts in the project are derived from the following open source projects:
